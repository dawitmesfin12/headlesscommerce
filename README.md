# Headless E-Commerce Solutions App (Built w/ Tailwind & Vue)

![tailwind-vue-app](https://snipcart.com/media/205230/tailwind-vue-app.png)

**The premise**

Last week, Snipcart was sponsoring Headless Commerce Summit, an event organized by Netlify. For a talk given by our CEO, Fran√ßois, we were trying to find a way to better visualize the difference between multiple headless e-commerce solutions. The opportunity was perfect for creating a Vue.js app and leveraging Tailwind CSS to make it visually appealing and easy to use quickly.

[Here's the resulting app!](https://headlesscommerce.netlify.app/)

The headless e-commerce solutions featured in the app are placed in 4 categories, depending on their characteristics:

- Monolithic
- Add-on
- Storefront
- API

We hope this app can help developers and merchants better understand the place of each of these e-commerce tools in the ecosystem. Feel free to add some by creating a pull request!

- Generating a Vue 3 app
- Setting up Tailwind CSS
- Defining data to play with Tailwind
- Pushing the configuration further
